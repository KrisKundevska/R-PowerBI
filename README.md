# R-PowerBI
This is a small project created as part of my training with Just IT. The tools used for this project are R Script and PowerBI
The data set HollywoodsMostProfitableStories.csv was provided by Just IT.
This data set was cleaned in R and is then used to creat visualisations in Power BI

Retrospective

Project Name: R-PowerBI Data Visualization

Summary:
The R-PowerBI project was part of my training with Just IT. It involved using R scripting to clean the "HollywoodsMostProfitableStories.csv" dataset and then creating visualizations in Power BI. The project requested the use of a green, brown, and blue color palette, and I created a custom theme in Power BI to accomplish this.

What Went Well:

Data Cleaning in R: The project effectively utilized R for data cleaning, ensuring that the dataset was ready for analysis.

Data Transformation: R scripting successfully transformed the raw data into a structured format suitable for visualization.

Data Visualization in Power BI: Power BI was used to create visualizations that allowed for effective data exploration and presentation, while the custom theme adhered to the requested color palette.

Integration of Tools: The project integrated R and Power BI to leverage the strengths of both tools.

What Could Be Improved:

Documentation: Providing comprehensive documentation for the data cleaning process in R and the steps taken in Power BI, including the custom theme creation, would enhance project understanding and future reference.

Data Insights: Given more time, deeper data analysis and insights could be derived, going beyond basic visualizations.

Data Source Updates: Regularly updating the dataset and ensuring automated data cleaning processes can streamline future projects.

Lessons Learned:

Data Preparation: Gained practical experience in data cleaning and transformation using R.

Data Visualization: Developed skills in creating effective visualizations in Power BI, including custom theme creation.

Integration of Tools: Realized the benefits of integrating multiple tools for comprehensive data analysis, while adhering to specific design requirements.

Future Steps:

For future projects, I plan to focus on detailed documentation, explore more advanced data analysis techniques, optimize data source updates, and continue to tailor visualizations to specific design requirements. Learning from this experience, I aim to create more insightful and well-documented data visualization projects that align with requested themes.

The R-PowerBI project was a valuable opportunity to apply data cleaning and visualization skills to real-world data, even as part of training. It emphasized the importance of clean data, design considerations, and comprehensive documentation for meaningful insights.
